# Machine Learning — Maktabkhooneh (MK1235) | My Implementations & Projects

This repository contains **my original implementations, assignments, and projects** aligned with the Maktabkhooneh course “آموزش یادگیری ماشین” (Machine Learning).  
- **Course page:** https://maktabkhooneh.org/course/%D8%A2%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%B4-%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AF%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B4%DB%8C%D9%86-mk1235/

> 💡 This repo also includes **selected training snippets from the course** (where licensing permits and clearly attributed), plus **my own projects** that extend the material with real-world workflows (data → features → modeling → evaluation → deployment).

---

## What you’ll find
- **Reproducible notebooks** for each module (EDA → modeling → evaluation).
- A small **`src/` package** of reusable utilities (data loading, preprocessing, modeling pipelines, metrics).
- **Tests** to keep notebooks/code stable.
- **Deployment examples** (Streamlit/FastAPI/Flask) for turning models into simple web apps.
- Optional **PyCaret** workflows for AutoML-style baselines and comparisons.
